# Why Julia?
This is a "why Julia" presentation. It's mainly meant as a teaser for people without any Computer Science background (you might find some of the terminology overly simplistic). I used it to explain to a group of non-systems biologists why I use Julia. Some of the reasoning behind the details in this talk can be found in [this](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/preaching-julia-to-biologists/15058?u=yakir12) Discourse topic. 

## How to use
I used [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md). So you can download the `presentation.md` and run 
```bash
reveal-md -w presentation.md
``` 
to see it locally on your browser. Or you can
```bash
reveal-md presentation.md --static folder2static
``` 
to generate a folder with all the needed files to host a static site of the presnetation. I hosted my presentation [here](https://yakir12.github.io/whyjulia/#/) on github. Google for answers on how to host a static website on github (e.g. [this](https://pages.github.com)), it's easier than you think.
